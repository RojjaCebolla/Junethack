Redesign objectives
===================

1. provide a bare-bones improved content hierarchy.
2. do not address accessibility or aesthetic issues.*
3. begin from webmocks/2013/content_design and docs/2013/contentmap_proposed2.md.
4. final html design will integrate into current layout.haml
5. complete within 1 week.
6. remove unnecessary markup.
7. don't optimise css.
8. if unnecessary markup can't be removed without optimising css, leave a comment suggesting future improvements.

* Except the 'back to top' link, but this is just a test feature and easily removed.
