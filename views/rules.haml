        Rules and scoring

        %p
          No cheating on game servers account registered to the tournament
          (examples of cheating include hacking a server to add fake games,
          abusing PRNG vulnerabilities to predict the future state of a game,
          exploiting memory-corrupting bugs). If we catch you, we'll disqualify
          you. However, we don't consider some things such as pudding farming
          or bones stuffing to be cheating. Use common sense.

          Streaks are sequences of non-overlapping games played on a single
          game server account, with no games in-between.

          The score for competitions and clan competitions is calculated as
          follows:
          %p
            %li
              Only the best game for each player is considered, for each
              category.
            %li
              The first place player(s) get 4 points, the second place
              player(s) get 3 points, the third place player(s) get 2 points,
              and the remaining players get points according to the ratio
              of their best evaluated game to the winner(s)' best evaluated
              game.
            %li
              In case of a tie, all the players with the same evaluation get
              the same amount of points; in the ranking, they're considered
              as one player.
            %li
              Games with negative scores are discarded for the "lowest scoring
              ascension" competition.

          The score for trophies is fixed - one point for each trophy;
          streak trophies are separate from their standard counterpart,
          the requirement for those is that all the requirements for the
          trophy are fulfilled in a sequence of ascensions on a single
          game server account.
          Achievement trophies yield equal fractions of a point according
          to how many achievements were obtained in the whole tournament.

        %p
          Cross-variant trophies exclude NetHack 1.3d; the "Sightseeing
          Tour" trophy requires a game from each variant to be played for at
          least 1000 turns, or to finish with an ascension; the "Globetrotter"
          trophy doesn't require a full trophy for each variant - a single
          achievement out of the set for each variant is enough.
        %p
          The "No membership card" and "Too good for a brain" trophies are
          UnNetHack-specific.
