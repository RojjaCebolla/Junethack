# IMAGES

* Design new trophy images
#	- do not need to exactly match previous icons.
#	- should match overall design.
#	- simple geometric shapes sufficient (bhaak)
#	- consider inverting colours of existing icons to create a new set.
#	- backpacking tourist:
#		- should be a backpack, but avoid combined lines (ie varying line weights)
		- looks a bit like a face - maybe straps taller (stenno)
#	- walk in the park:
#		- humanist a, big @ relative to legs, polished/even lines.
#	- hemi-stoner:
#		- don't go with cigarette - maybe just recolour the existing anti-stoner. (bhaak)
		- brighter red please (bhaak)
#	- prince of the world:
#		- prince, king of the world looks good.
