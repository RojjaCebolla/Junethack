IMAGES

* Design new trophy images
#	- do not need to exactly match previous icons.
#	- should match overall design.
#	- simple geometric shapes sufficient (bhaak)
#	- consider inverting colours of existing icons to create a new set.
#	- backpacking tourist:
#		- should be a backpack, but avoid combined lines (ie varying line weights)
#		- looks a bit like a face - maybe straps taller (stenno)
#	- walk in the park:
#		- humanist a, big @ relative to legs, polished/even lines.
#	- hemi-stoner:
#		- don't go with cigarette - maybe just recolour the existing anti-stoner. (bhaak)
#		- brighter red please (bhaak)
#	- prince of the world:
#		- prince, king of the world looks good.
#		- king: magenta (bhaak)
  - most medusa killS
#  - most games with all conducts broken
    - 12 conducts, not 13.  Idea of a fading-away number.
  - heaven or hell (1hp mode)

* Other icon images that are not trophies
  - gold, silver and bronze candelabra next to 1st/2nd/3rd clan places
