# Bugs

* clan score is sum of all user's accounts, not just the user's accounts that belong to the clan. eg xaiph on nfi and xaiph on nao are in different clans, but all their points are attributed to both clans. *cheryl*
* non-standard clan names such as blister's "~|:{" causing some URI errors. *blister, s1g, cheryl*
* non-standard clan names such as blister's "~|:{" preventing clearspan from being created on /home. *cheryl*

#### Fixed

* /clans displays all server accounts, not just people, under "members". *Pd0x*
* /clans: clan admin is not displaying the right person. *rawrmage*
* navigating from /clan/anything or /user/anything to another level directory such as /about or /rules gives us /clan/rules or /user/rules etc. *cheryl*
* developers link should display authors.txt *PaRaD0xx*

# Improvements

* Improve selectbox of list of clans on /home. *rawrmage*

#### Implemented

* Add a link to the signup form into the login form. *TjrWiz*
* Improve selectbox of list of clans on /home *rawrmage*

# New features
