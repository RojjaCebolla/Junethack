- 'Generated statistics' can be just 'statistics'
- 'About > The project' is awkward.  Suggestions:
  - Community
  - Junethack
  - Get involved
- Logo in the middle splits the text awkwardly
- Results could just have one scoreboard link
  - possibly merge clan scoreboard and user scoreboard
- Replace games, ascensions, deaths with a games page filterable by various criteria (a la nethack.eu)
