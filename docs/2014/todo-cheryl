2014

IMAGES

* Design new trophy images
#	- do not need to exactly match previous icons.
#	- should match overall design.
#	- simple geometric shapes sufficient (bhaak)
#	- consider inverting colours of existing icons to create a new set.
  - most medusa killS
* Other icon images that are not trophies
  - gold, silver and bronze candelabra next to 1st/2nd/3rd clan places

CSS/HTML

* Usability: Rules page is confusing to read, some people don't realise there are two lists.
  log:
  - Made one main header with a subheading for each list
  - Made verbs at start of lists imperatives instead of gerunds.
  - No redundant byline explaining the header.
  - Removed or rephrased other redundant or obvious text
  - Moved 'punishments' line to top paragraph
  - Took out explanations of each cheating/not cheating item: this is not a tutorial!
  - Used more conversational writing style

META
