# Observations:

Most of the content is available within 1 click.  This superficially suggests good usability, but in fact belies a lack of hierarchy and overall structure to the content displayed.  This lack of structure makes it harder for users to keep track of the diverse content available on the site.  This may result in more unnecessary clicks as the user attempts to navigate to where the piece of content they were looking for is located.

## Specific observations

- Some content is linked redundantly (eg 3.2. clan scores in topnav and footer)
- Some relatively important static content is only available 2 clicks from the front page (5.3 contact) while other equally static, less important content is linked from the footer on all pages (eg 5.1. developers)
- Some content needs to be more accessible.  eg 4.2. trophies, which users may wish to view repeatedly as a reference but it is accessible far down within the front page text or in the footer.
- On the other hand, some content is too accessible when users may not wish to view it (eg 5.1. developers, 1.1. register).  This type of content could be located 2 or more clicks from the front page and would free up space for more important content to be focused on.
- Some content that would make sense together is structured as if it were unrelated (eg 2.1.4. generated statistics and the rest of 2.1. statistics).

## Non-content observations:

- Some pages are extremely long, sometimes requiring a lot of scrolling to reach the desired information (eg 4.2. trophies, 3.1. scoreboard)
- Some pages are not really adequately styled (eg 3.1. scoreboard).  They are legible, but not enjoyable, to read.
