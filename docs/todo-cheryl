2014

IMAGES

* Design new trophy images
#	- do not need to exactly match previous icons.
#	- should match overall design.
#	- simple geometric shapes sufficient (bhaak)
#	- consider inverting colours of existing icons to create a new set.
  - most medusa killS
  - heaven or hell (1hp mode)
    - halo over trident? Example in icons/working

* Other icon images that are not trophies
  - gold, silver and bronze candelabra next to 1st/2nd/3rd clan places

META

Clear outdated folders
 - Move documentation for this year's development to docs/2013
 - clear webmocks
 - remove old icons?
 - what are we doing with the content map?  I made an example located in webmocks/2013_contentdesign - see from an information architecture perspective
