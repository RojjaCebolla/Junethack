User objectives (presumed, since we can't do any actual user research right now) (hm, maybe we should implement that for this year)

- trophies:
  - what trophies does UserX have?
    - given a trophy, which users have achieved it across all variants?
    - given a trophy, which users have achieved it in this variant?
  - what variants should UserX try to get more trophies? (feature request)
- competitive categories
  - who is/are winning category X for variant Y and what was their score?
- clan scoreboard
  - what are the placings and scores of the clan competition?
  - how is that broken down into competitive categories?


Proposed structure:

- trophies
  - merge trophy information into the user list, eg 2d table players x trophy names (content: variants), or players x variants (content: trophies)
  - user list moved to the results section and named "trophies".  Less noise in the stats list, more scaffolding in the results list.
  - later maybe include in /scoreboard a competitive trophy section, eg:
    - How do your trophies compare with everyone else's? (eg number)
    - What variants should you try to get more trophies?
- player scoreboard
  - Example structures
    - Variants are generally static, so are categories.  Placings are what change during the course of the tournament.
    - Exception markup:
      - no ascensions:
        - don't give an empty table.
        - eg "No one's ascended [this variant] yet!  Take the gold now!"
      - 1 ascension (and placing) in the whole variant:
        - eg "User X made the only ascension and wins all the categories a, b, c..."
    - General case markup (eg a number of different users take out all the categories)
      - List by variants, category x placings
        - Variantname Table: Placing (1st | 2nd | 3rd)
          - Category a: User X | User Z | User Y
          - category b: User X | User Y | User Z
          - category c: User Z | User X | User Y
        --> A compact form of the existing structure.  This allows us to compare within each variant.
        - Responsive: Variant Category tables:
          - Variant a Category A: (Place, User, Score)
            - 1 | User X | 2039849
            - 2 | User Y | 390298
            - 3 | User Z | 29039
          - (etc through the categories, then through the variants.
        - Or, if necessary, Variant Category tables using single axis:
          - Variant a Category A
            - Place: 1
            - Score: 2308923
            - Player: User X
            - Place: 2
            - Score: 283859
            - Player: User Y
            - Place: 3
            - Score: 50398
            - Player: User Z
          - Though we really need something between single axis and table-per-variant.  Ideally still table per variant with row groups as categories.
- clan scoreboard
  - Summary as per existing table
  - Breakdown of clan points
    - Variants are generally static, so are categories.  Placings are what change during the course of the tournament.
    - Markup options:
      - no games by any clan qualify for this category:
        - don't give an empty table.
        - eg "No clans have qualified for this category yet! Take the first place now!"
      - Wider screens can use two axes:
        - Categoryname Table: Clan name | Points
          - Place 1:
          - Place 2:
          - Place 3:
      - Responsive screens:
        - Categoryname Table
          - Placing 1:
          - Placing 1 Clanname:
          - Placing 1 Points:
          - Placing 2:
          - Placing 2 Clanname:
          - Placing 2 Points:
