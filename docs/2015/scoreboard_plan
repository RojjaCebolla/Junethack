User objectives (presumed, since we can't do any actual user research right now) (hm, maybe we should implement that for this year)
- trophies:
  - what trophies does UserX have?
    - given a trophy, which users have achieved it across all variants?
    - given a trophy, which users have achieved it in this variant?
  - how does UserX's trophies compare with UserY's trophies?
  - what variants should UserX try to get more trophies? (feature request)
- competitive categories
  - who is/are winning category X for variant Y?
  - what was their score?
- clan scoreboard
  - what are the placings and scores of the clan competition?
  - how is that broken down into competitive categories?


Proposed structure:
- trophies
  - merge trophy information into the user list, eg 2d table players x trophy names (content: variants), or players x variants (content: trophies)
  - user list moved to the results section and named "trophies".  Less noise in the stats list, more scaffolding in the results list.
- player scoreboard
  - comparing within variants, who is winning the competitive category?
    - existing structure is mostly appropriate: variant > category > user
    - variants with fewer than 4 ascensions in total: compact version starting with user > category
  - comparing within competitive categories, who is winning 
  - comparing across variants, who is winning the competitive category?
    - just one comparison: category > user (also appropriate)
- clan scoreboard
